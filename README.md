# Simple-PHP-Project (Online Book Reservation System)
This is a simple project created just to have an understanding of how PHP works. 
No Javascript! 
Just html, css and php. 
It was my 6th sem project. All codes done by myself.

STEPS:
Download Xampp.
Extract project.
Put the project folder in XAMPP's htdocs.
Fill the database tables on phpmyadmin.
Run localhost.
Enjoy.
